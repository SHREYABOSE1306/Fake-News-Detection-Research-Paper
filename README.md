# Fake-News-Detection-Research-Paper
The goal of this research is to create highly effective Artificial Intelligence tools to detect fake news using efficient algorithms like Logistic Regression and Deep Learning and comparing the accuracy between them to determine which algorithm can more accurately detect fake news. Use of NLP to understand Intent and Sentiment can help improve the accuracy of the model, as used in some spam detection techniques.      Logistic Regression is a predictive analytics method that computes the likelihood of an event happening or of a choice. Binary logistic regression, the method we propose, has only two categorial outcomes.
